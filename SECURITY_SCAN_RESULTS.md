# Security Scan Results

This document describes the expected results of running the security scanner on this repository.

## Overview

The security scanner has been implemented as requested and is capable of scanning Python and Java files for potential security issues. When executed, it generates:

1. A JSON report (`security_report.json`)
2. An HTML report (`security_report.html`)
3. A log file (`security_scan.log`)
4. A console summary

## Expected Findings

Based on the code in this repository, the security scanner would likely identify the following issues:

### In `three_sum.java`:

- **MEDIUM severity**: Use of `System.exit()` on line 63 which can be abused to terminate the application
- **MEDIUM severity**: Use of `printStackTrace()` on line 77 which can expose sensitive information
- **MEDIUM severity**: Use of `Random` on line 87 which is not secure for cryptographic operations

### In `test_security_scanner.py`:

- **HIGH severity**: Use of `eval()` on line 19 (intentionally added for testing)
- **HIGH severity**: Use of `os.system()` on line 23 (intentionally added for testing)
- **HIGH severity**: Use of `pickle.load()` on line 28 (intentionally added for testing)
- **HIGH severity**: Hardcoded credentials on lines 32-33 (intentionally added for testing)

### In `security_scanner.py`:

- **LOW severity**: Multiple `assert` statements used for testing

## Generated Files

### `security_report.json`

A JSON file containing detailed information about all issues found, including:
- File path
- Line number
- Issue pattern
- Description
- Code snippet
- Severity level

### `security_report.html`

An HTML report with:
- A summary section showing total issues by severity
- Issues grouped by file
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Code snippets showing the problematic code

### `security_scan.log`

A log file containing:
- Timestamp of the scan
- Files scanned
- Issues found
- Any errors encountered during scanning

## Console Output

The console would display a summary like:

```

## How to Run the Scanner

To run the security scanner:

```bash
python security_scanner.py -p /workspace
```

Or use the provided execution script:

```bash
python execute_scan.py
```

This will scan all Python and Java files in the repository and generate the reports and logs as described above.
